# PayrollHero Core API

# Group Authentication

Authentication to the Core API is done through Payrollhero Auth

## Token Based Authentication

OAUTH2 authentication process against https://auth.payrollhero.com.

#### Parameters

    + token (string, optional) ... OAuth Token from auth.payrollhero.com

## Signature Based Authentication

#### Parameters

    + oauth_signature (string, optional) ... Base64 encoded oauth signature string
    + oauth_key_id (string) ... Key identifier for the public key for this signature string
    + oauth_nonce (string) ... Nonce used for this signature
    + oauth_signature_method (string) ... The oauth signature method used. Currently only supports 'rsa-sha256'.
    + oauth_timestamp (unix_timestamp) ... The timestamp for this request in seconds epoch.

# Group Clocking Logic

## What is this section?

This section is meant to document a bunch of logic around clocking. Specifically for custom Time Clock implementations.

## Summary

The idea is as follows:

There is 3 states `open`, `closest` and `unscheduled`

### But first .. 'likely' clock out time

Is a concept of what is the employee's likely clock out time.

In the case when the employee has a schedule, it will be their actual scheduled clock out time.

In the case when they do not, it will be the time they clocked out plus their usual shift length (8 hours normally)

### Open

If an employee is:
+ currently already clocked in
+ not clocked out
+ can be on break or not
+ not later than 10 hours past their likely clock out time
+ not outside of their early/late thresholds for clocking out (separate section will explain thresholds)

### Closest

If an employee is:
+ not currently clocked in
+ they are no more than 10 hours away from the start of their shift (early or late)
+ not outside their early/late in thresholds

### Unscheduled

If an employee is:
+ allowed to clock unscheduled

### Thresholds

There is thresholds for `clocking in` and `clocking out`. And there is separate variants for being `early` or `late` for each.

There is also a boolean flag if an employee is allowed to cross each of there thresholds.

The threshold check is meant to allow fine tuned control of when an employee sees themselves on the Time Clock.

This way if an employee is early by 30 minutes, and their `early in` threshold is 15 minutes, and they're not allowed to cross it
the ui should not allow them to clock in.
