# PayrollHero Core API

# Group Authentication

Authentication to the Core API is done through Payrollhero Auth.

Retrieving a token from Payrollhero Auth.

There are two ways of getting the token from Payrollhero Auth. One could iether use 3-legged OAuth
authentication or 2-legged OAuth authentication.

## Token Based Authentication

Authentication can be done with the use of a token. The token can be obtained by doing a 2 or 3 legged
OAUTH2 authentication process against https://auth.payrollhero.com.

#### Parameters

    + token (string, optional) ... OAuth Token from auth.payrollhero.com

## Signature Based Authentication

#### Parameters

    + oauth_signature (string, optional) ... Base64 encoded oauth signature string
    + oauth_key_id (string) ... Key identifier for the public key for this signature string
    + oauth_nonce (string) ... Nonce used for this signature
    + oauth_signature_method (string) ... The oauth signature method used. Currently only supports 'rsa-sha256'.
    + oauth_timestamp (unix_timestamp) ... The timestamp for this request in seconds epoch.

# Group 3-legged OAuth Authentication

The 3-legged OAuth authentication works well with websites when the user could be redirected to Payrollhero
Auth.

The token could be retrieved by following these steps:

  * Step 1: Redirect the user to https://auth.payrollhero.com/oauth/authorize
  * Step 2: User authorizes the application
  * Step 3: PayrollHero Auth redirects the user back to the application with the code
  * Step 4: Application exchange the code for a token
  * Step 5: Application uses the token to access the rest of the API

    + client_id (required, string) ... Application's client ID obtained from PayrollHero.
    + redirect_uri (required, string) ... Determines where the response is sent. The value must exactly match
      what was registered with PayrollHero.

      possible values.

### Code - Step 3 [GET]

+ Parameters
    + code (required, string) ... The code that could be exchanged for a token.
    + scope (optional, string) ... The scope that was authorized by the user.
    + state (optional, string) ... The verbatim state that was sent on step 1.

# Group 2-legged OAuth Authentication

The 2-legged OAuth authentication works well with desktop applications when it's difficult to redirect users.

The application would need to gather the username and password and request PayrollHero Auth for the token.

### Authorize/Authenticate [POST]

+ Parameters
    + client_id (required, string) ... Application's client ID obtained from PayrollHero.
    + client_secret (required, string) ... Application's client secret set on PayrollHero.

    }

# Group Clocking Logic

## What is this section?

This section is meant to document a bunch of logic around clocking. Specifically for custom Time Clock implementations.

## Summary

The idea is as follows:

There is 3 states a shift can be in: `open`, `closest` and `unscheduled`

### But first .. 'likely' clock out time

Is a concept of what is the employee's likely clock out time.

In the case when the employee has a schedule, it will be their actual scheduled clock out time.

In the case when they do not, it will be the time they clocked out plus their usual shift length (8 hours normally)

### Open

If an employee is:
+ currently already clocked in
+ not clocked out
+ can be on break or not
+ not later than 10 hours past their likely clock out time
+ not outside of their early/late thresholds for clocking out (separate section will explain thresholds)

### Closest

If an employee is:
+ not currently clocked in
+ they are no more than 10 hours away from the start of their shift (early or late)
+ not outside their early/late in thresholds

### Unscheduled

If an employee is:
+ allowed to clock unscheduled

### Thresholds

There is thresholds for `clocking in` and `clocking out`. And there is separate variants for being `early` or `late` for each.

There is also a boolean flag if an employee is allowed to cross each of there thresholds.

The threshold check is meant to allow fine tuned control of when an employee sees themselves on the Time Clock.

This way if an employee is early by 30 minutes, and their `early in` threshold is 15 minutes, and they're not allowed to cross it
the ui should not allow them to clock in.

## PhotoWall Backgrounds Collection [/api/v2/backgrounds{?token}]

### List all processed photo wall backgrounds [GET]

__Scope Required:__ `read_backgrounds`

Returns a collection keyed with information about generated backgrounds containing employee photos.  Two orientations for the photos
are returned.  The 'horizontal' is more appropriate for display when the width is greater than the height of the viewport
and the 'vertical' is more appropriate when the height is greater than the width.  This endpoint will return new photo walls occasionally.
Any consumer of this endpoint is guaranteed to receive 3 different background images per day.
